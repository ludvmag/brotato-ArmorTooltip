# Improved Armor Tooltip

Improved armor tooltip for Brotato. Modifies the text for armor on upgrades, items and character selection. Shows the percentage damage reduction/increase that the armor modifiter would result in. Since armor has diminishing returns and gets less valueable for each point of armor you already have this can help the player decide wether to pick or disregard armor upgrades and items.
